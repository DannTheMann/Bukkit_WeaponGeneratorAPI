# WeaponGeneratorAPI
Used to create the simulated case openings, also used to illustrate weapon generation for other plugins.

One of my last plugins, really loved this one!

Not sure if this has been now, but being that this was created a year ago! It was a first if I ever saw one. 

Would generate weapons and spin them in a case opening. Similar to CSGO! 

Otherwise I often used it other plugins to help me generate random weapons for rewards.
